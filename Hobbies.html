        <p>Celeste Mcdonald is a cosplayer from the United states with a variety on interests including Cosplaying, video games, making accessories, violin, dancing, kpop, disney, and playing with her puppy. While most of these tie together they are all important to her. Particularly her dog Minnie that Is a black lab. Conventions are a common place where most of this tie together and events that Celeste enjoys going to her last one was Nan Desu Kan in Aurora Colorado. Where here newest cosplay was in full display being Ayato from the game Genshin Impact.  Cosplay itself falls into a few categories when talking about hobbies the events are Conventions which are on typically a 3 day weekend with Saturday being the main day. This is where you show off completed or even in progress works as part of a fandom such as Genshin impact, Kingdom Hearts, or Fairy Tail. Before that is building cosplays which are either from an assortment of props/ items combined into one costume, buying the costume from a seller, or building each prop from scratch out of materials like EVA foam, 3d printers, or cardboard even. This Creativity steeps into every aspect of her life and shows dedication based on the time it takes to do all of the hard work that goes into each cosplay. On day of the events and leading up to it. This of course is still not including the time it takes to watch and consume the TV shows or video games that the cosplay is about.</p>
