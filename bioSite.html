        <p>Celeste Mcdonald is from the state of Kansas. She has lived her entire life around the Kansas City area. Her activities have been relatively static always enjoying videogames and anime being primary. While her grandmother has always been a focus in her life along with pets which the most recent is Minnie who is a black lab. She graduated from High School in 2016. Her current focus in life is mostly focusing at refining her craft of cosplay and creating items. Along with lots of gaming as well and KPOP. In 2022 she managed to be able to go to the LUNA concert which is her favorite KPOP band. She has been to a lot of cons however the pandemic has slowed cons considerably during its duration due to it limiting public gatherings. Cons in their nature are public gatherings so for the last 3 years at this point in time cons have been relatively limited in nature and scope if they have happened at all. With the inclusions of masks at most cons at this point has changed how cosplay is done with changes to make up and making the masks work with the character that they are portraying. This has also changed things that have to be made or ordered in order to better fit into character and to at a minimum to keep the color palate of the character intact. While this has changed to an extent how cosplays function Celeste has adapted to fit the current situation.</p>
